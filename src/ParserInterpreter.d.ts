     *  As an implementation limitation right now, you can only specify one
     *  override. This is sufficient to allow construction of different
     *  parse trees for ambiguous input. It means re-parsing the entire input
     *  in general because you're never sure where an ambiguous sequence would
     *  live in the various parse trees. For example, in one interpretation,
     *  an ambiguous input sequence would be matched completely in expression
     *  but in another it could match all the way back to the root.

     *  e, as in: (e ID !).

     *  Rather than trying to optimize this and make

     *  just re-parsing the whole input and then using
     *  {link Trees#getRootOfSubtreeEnclosingRegion} to find the minimal
